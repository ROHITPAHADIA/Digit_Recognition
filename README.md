*Overview                                        
-This project implements a digit recognition system using machine learning techniques. It is designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to achieve high accuracy in identifying digits from images.

*Technologies Used
-Python
-Google Collab

*Libraries:
-NumPy
-Matplotlib
-Scikit-learn
-TensorFlow/Keras

*Steps
-Data preprocessing steps
-Model training
-Evaluation of model performance
-Predictions on test data

*Results
-The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 97%. 

*Conclusion
-This digit recognition project demonstrates the ability of neural network to classify images accurately. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with advanced techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
